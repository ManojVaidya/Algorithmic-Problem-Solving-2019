Binomial Coefficients
DP 2-d:
	coeff(n,0)=1 and coeff(n,n)=1
	coeff(n,k)=coeff(n-1,k-1) + coeff(n-1,k)
	Uses precomputed data for subsequent iterations after initialization.Can access any computed value from 2-d array.
	Space complexity: O(n*k)
DP 1-d:
	coeff(0)=1, coeff(1 to n)=0
	coeff(n)=coeff(n) + coeff(n-1)
	Overwrites data for each iteration.Binomial coefficients of single row can be accessed after each iteration.
	Space complexity: O(k) 
Recursion:
	Returns 1 if k=0 or n=k. Return coeff(n-1,k-1) + coeff(n-1,k) otherwise.
	Memory allocated for each recursive call : (2^n-1)*8 bytes
	Inefficient for large values of n.
